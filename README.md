### Protip: Visual Studio Code snippets

'snippets': shortcuts for quickly generating commonly re-used portions of code

Instructions for creating snippets can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_creating-your-own-snippets).

Useful, ready-made snippets can also be found as VS Code plugins, in the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets).

The most important snippet is the one for the <em>console.log()</em> command, for example, <em>clog</em>. This can be created like so:

```js
{
  "console.log": {
    "prefix": "clog",
    "body": [
      "console.log('$1')",
    ],
    "description": "Log output to console"
  }
}
```

Debugging your code using _console.log()_ is so common that Visual Studio Code has that snippet built in. To use it, type _log_ and hit Tab to autocomplete. More fully featured _console.log()_ snippet extensions can be found in the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=console.log&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance).

### JavaScript Arrays

From here on out, we will be using the functional programming operators of the JavaScript [array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), such as _find_, _filter_, and _map_ - all of the time.

If operating arrays with functional operators feels foreign to you, it is worth watching at least the first three parts of the YouTube video series [Functional Programming in JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84):

- [Higher-order functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUiFMZr7vk&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84)
- [Map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCqtb-Z5YGQ&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84&index=2)
- [Reduce basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl98eZpkp-c&t=31s)

### Map

Understanding how the array method [`map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) works is crucial for the rest of the course.

> React uses the key attributes of objects in an array to determine how to update the view generated by a component when the component is re-rendered. More about this is in the [React documentation](https://react.dev/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state#option-2-resetting-state-with-a-key).

Let's pause for a moment and examine how _map_ works.

```js
const result = notes.map((note) => note.id);
console.log(result);
```

<i>[1, 2, 3]</i> will be printed to the console.
_map_ always creates a new array, the elements of which have been created from the elements of the original array by <i>mapping</i>: using the function given as a parameter to the _map_ method.

The function is

```js
(note) => note.id;
```

The function gets a note object as a parameter and returns the value of its id field.

### Anti-pattern: Array Indexes as Keys

This is, however, **not recommended** and can create undesired problems even if it seems to be working just fine.
